# Multiplayer Hangman Game

This is a typical hangman game that we used to play in elementary school. This version is multiplayer so it allows you to login two players to play agains each other. 

## Technologies

### Backend
The backend was built using Node.js with some frameworks and packages such as Express.js that serves as a middleware. Most of the data are stored and fetched from a database written in MySQL.

###  Frontend
HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript was used for this project for the sake of simplicity. We fetch data with a simple fetch() request and we manipulate the DOM directly in Javascript.

## Usage
The project comes with two servers. To run the scoresserver, simply navigate to the folder and run node.js. To run the main server, run node.js in the main directory.
